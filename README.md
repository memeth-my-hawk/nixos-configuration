# nixos-configuration
My NixOS configuration files. No home-manager, no flakes, nothing. Just plain nix.

## But why?
Because I don't want to rely on a third party tool like home-manager or some experimental feature that no one really can wrap their heads around. I understand the system itself and it is useful enough for me. I do the same stuff on NixOS just as I would do on other classic distributions and still enjoy its declarative merits and properties.
